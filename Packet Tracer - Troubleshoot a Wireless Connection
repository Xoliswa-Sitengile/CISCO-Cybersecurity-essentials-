Detailed Documentation: Packet Tracer - Troubleshoot a Wireless Connection
Overview
This project demonstrates the process of troubleshooting a wireless connection using Cisco Packet Tracer. The activity emphasizes identifying, diagnosing, and resolving wireless connectivity issues while highlighting best practices and common tools.

Objectives
Identify and resolve wireless connectivity issues on a laptop.
Access a wireless router to verify and modify its configuration.
Connect a laptop to a wireless network using WPA2-PSK security.
Develop a systematic approach to troubleshooting network problems.

Steps Performed
1. Identify Laptop Wireless Issues
Used ping and tracert commands to verify connectivity and trace the network path to the destination.
Navigated to a web page to confirm the network was inaccessible.
2. Discover the Wireless Router's IP Address
Opened the command prompt on the laptop and used the ipconfig command to determine the default gateway address.
3. Access the Wireless Router
Logged into the wireless router using the default gateway IP address.
Verified configurations, including wireless security settings and device status.
4. Resolve Configuration Issues
Corrected misconfigurations in the wireless router settings, such as enabling WPA2-PSK security and updating the passphrase.
Modified laptop wireless settings to connect to the secured network using the updated credentials.
5. Validate Connection
Retested connectivity by accessing a web page and confirming successful connection to the network.
Reflection and Learning
Key Questions and Answers
1. How did you discover the IP address of the wireless router?

Used the ipconfig command on the command prompt to find the default gateway address.
2. What is the difference between using the ping command and the tracert command?

The ping command verifies if the destination is reachable and measures response time, while the tracert command traces the path to the destination, providing details about intermediate devices.
3. Why is it important to change the default username and password for a wireless router?

Default credentials are publicly available and pose a significant security risk if not changed.
4. How do you feel about the troubleshooting process?

Troubleshooting can initially feel complex, but a systematic approach makes it manageable and rewarding as it builds confidence and problem-solving skills.
5. What did you learn about your troubleshooting process?

Systematic and organized troubleshooting greatly improves efficiency. Practice and reading about troubleshooting techniques enhance this skill.
